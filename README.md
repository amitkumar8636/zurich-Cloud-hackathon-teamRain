## FAQ

#### Can we do it with Terraform latest version?

Yes, You can give a try. However i have tested it on the above mention version in the installation steps. 

#### Have you used local backend?

Yes, I have used local backed. However the code is provided for S3 backend as well. Only thing you need to do is to provide the your s3 bucket name and uncomment that part of code in the provider.tf 


#### What will happen if we put multiple customer file in one upload?

You can put multiple customer json file in one go. however things to keep in mind that all json file should have the same scheme(attribute) mention below:
```json 
{
    "customer_id" :123456,
    "customer_name": "Amit Kumar",
    "location": "Krakow, Poland",
    "other_data": "Based on Requirement"

}
```

#### Do i need to provide any variable value in the terrform code?
Not required, All variable has a default value provided, You can alter as well

#### Can we alter schema of the jsonfile?
Partially yes, The customer_id and Customer_name are primary and secondry indexes of the table. You cant modify just the file. You need to alter the terraform variables as well to fix that.

#### How do we know the failures of events if we uploaded multiple customers file?
You can check the cloudwatch logs for the successful and failures of customer with customer_id also you can use dynamodb query to search the suspected one
